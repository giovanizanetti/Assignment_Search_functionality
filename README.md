## Goals for this project:

- Get an offer to work for this company.
- Make a working application.
- Practice software development. Practice and learn more about Vue.js
- Showcase some of what I can do.

## Requirements

1.  Fetch data from API
    `API documentation: http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/unanswered-questions`
2.   The application should allow the user to search on a tag and then display the results underneath in a nicely formatted list.
3.   Use preferably the Vue.js javascript framework
4.  Implement autocomplete functionality

## Features built so far

### 1. Search for Stack Overflow unanswered questions
- The user can search for a tag by typing and pressing`search` or `enter` key.
- Each question result contains:
    - Name,
    - Date of creation
    - User's avatar
    - User's name

### 2. Autocomplete
- The autocomplete functionality works when the user types
- The user will receive a list of 10 suggestions, sometimes even if they did not finish typing.
- A new API call is made every time the user stops typing for 500 milliseconds or more. I use `lodash.debounce` helper for this.
- A search with the suggestion tag is performed when clicked.

### 3. Go to question
- Questions results are clickable and leads to the Stack Overflow, to the page of the question.
- The user can return to the results and still see their results. I use the browser local storage for that

### 4.Load more
- The user can load more extra 5 results by pressing`...load more` handler
- Refreshing the page does not clear the results.

### 5. Clear
- The user can clear the search results by pressing the `clear` handler.
